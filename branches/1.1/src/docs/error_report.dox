When an error occurs, CrashRpt notifies the user and allows  
to review the report contents. First the <b>Error Report</b> dialog shown above is displayed.

User can optionally provide his/her E-mail address and a short problem 
description. The E-mail address may be used later by software support staff to
contact the user and ask for additional information about the problem.

The <i>What does this report contain?</i> link opens the details dialog.

\section detaildlg Error Report Details Dialog

The <b>Error Report Details</b> dialog contains files that are presented in the report. 
Double clicking a filename opens the file using its associated program, 
if an association exists for the file type.

<b>Since v.1.1.2</b> you can use a privacy policy describing what user 
information your software collects on crash. You provide the URL of your privacy 
policy HTML document published on your web site or distributed with your software.
If you need a template you may use this one: 
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/crashrpt/wiki/PrivacyPolicyTemplate">PrivacyPolicyTemplate</a>. 

The error report refers to a collection of files intended to help the developer 
diagnose the cause of the crash. 

The error report contains crash minidump file (crashdump.dmp), which has operating system 
version, processor type, CPU registers state and local variables and stack trace for each 
execution thread. The minidump in most cases can be used on developer's side to determine 
the reason of the crash and try to fix the problem.

In addition, CrashRpt generates an XML crash descriptor file. The file contains various
information that might be useful for crash analysis.

Custom files, for example, application log files, can be included into crash report via the 
crash callback.

Once the user is satisfied, he/she may close the details dialog and click the 'Send report' 
button on the main dialog. If the user doesn't want to send the report, the user clicks the 
'Close the program' button.

\section progressdlg Sending Error Report Dialog

The <b>Sending Error Report</b> dialog shows the progress of sending the error report. There are
maximum three attempts to send the report: using HTTP, using SMTP, and using Simple MAPI. The client
application may specify the order of attempts. By default HTTP connection is tried the first, SMTP
connection is tried the second, and Simple MAPI is tried the last.

There is the status log area below the progress bar. It contains the details of report
sending process. You can copy some selected lines or the whole log to the clipboard. To do this,
select several lines of the log, right-click the selection and choose an item in the context menu. 
The log may be useful when troubleshooting some error report sending problem.
