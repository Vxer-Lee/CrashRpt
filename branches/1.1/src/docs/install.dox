\section structure Solution Structure

There are several projects in CrashRpt solution.

- \b CrashRpt project contains 
  API implementation and provides functionality to intercept exceptions
  and generate error reports.

- \b CrashSender project contains functionality 
  for displaying GUI, sending the error report and show error report sending progress.

- \b CrashRptTest is a GUI application that helps to check that 
   CrashRpt API functions work as expected.

- \b crashcon is a console application that helps to test how CrashRpt
  works with console applications.

- \b zlib project contains file compression functionality.
   

\section compilation Compilation

You can use CrashRpt in C++ programs created using Visual C++. You can't 
use it in .NET or Visual Basic. Languages other than Visual C++ 
have different error handling mechanisms and CrashRpt can't intercept 
errors in other programming languages. 

You can compile and use CrashRpt in <b>Visual C++ .NET 2003</b>, <b>Visual C++ 2005</b>, 
<b>Visual C++ 2008</b> and <b>Visual C++ Express</b>.

By default CrashRpt release package already contains binary files 
compiled with Visual Studio 2005 in its \c bin directory. 
However, it is strongly recommended that you compile
CrashRpt yourself using your version of Visual Studio. This is needed to
ensure CrashRpt uses the same version of C run-time libraries (CRT) as 
your application does.

To compile CrashRpt follow these steps:

-# Download and unzip the source code of CrashRpt to any directory. 
-# Download the latest version of WTL from 
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/wtl">here</a>.
Unzip the WTL archive to some folder. In Visual Studio, open Tools->
Options->Projects and Solutions->VC++ Directories.
In the 'Show directories for' combo select 'Include files', then add 
the path to WTL\\include directory to the list of include directories.
-# Open one of solution files available in the top level directory of 
CrashRpt package, depending on your version of Visual Studio:
 - <b>CrashRpt_vs.NET.sln</b> 
 - <b>CrashRpt_vs2005.sln</b>
 - <b>CrashRpt_vs2008.sln</b>
-# Choose the Release build configuration and press F7 to build the solution.

<b>Notes about compiling in Visual C++ Express</b>

CrashRpt depends on WTL library. WTL is an open source 
project. It constantly evolves and adapts to new versions of Visual Studio 
(including VS Express). The latest version at the moment is WTL 8.1.

WTL itself depends on Microsoft's library called ATL (Active Template Library). 
ATL library is a part of Visual Studio SDKs. The latest version at the moment 
is ATL 8.0. An older version, ATL 3.0 is also included into Microsoft Platform 
SDK for Windows Server 2003. Since then, Platform SDK was renamed into Windows 
SDK and the latest version (at the moment) of Windows SDK is v6.0. However, 
Microsoft didn't include ATL into Windows SDK v6.0 to encourage using of 
commercial Visual Studio having ATL. The dependency on ATL introduces a lot of 
problems for WTL, so in the future WTL developers might remove this dependency 
at all (if possible).

To compile CrashRpt in Visual C++ Express, you need to have Platform SDK for 
Windows Server 2003, since it is the only Platform SDK that supports ATL.
Download and install Microsoft Platform SDK for Windows Server 2003, for example
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=A55B6B43-E24F-4EA3-A93E-40C0EC4F68E5&displaylang=en">
from here </a>.

In VC++ Express window, open Tools->Options...->Projects and Solutions->
VC++ Directories. In the 'Show directories for' combo, select 'Include files' 
and then add [Platform_SDK_Folder]\\Include\\atl\\ path to the list of include 
directories.

\section link Include and Lib Directories

It is recommened that you let the Visual C++ compiler know about CrashRpt 
using the following steps:

In Visual Studio window, open Tools->
Options->Projects and Solutions->VC++ Directories.
- In the 'Show directories for' combo select 'Include files', then add 
  the path to [CRASHRPT_HOME]\\CrashRpt\\include directory to the list below.
- In the 'Show directories for' combo select 'Library files', then add 
  the path to [CRASHRPT_HOME]\\lib directory to the list below.
- In the 'Show directories for' combo select 'Executable files', then add 
  the path to [CRASHRPT_HOME]\\bin directory to the list below.

Here [CRASHRPT_HOME] should be replaced with the actual path of the 
directory you unzipped CrashRpt package to.

\section builddox Generating Project Documentation

By default project documentation is already generated and included into the CrashRpt release
package. To open the documentation, click \c index.html file in the top-level directrory of 
CrashRpt package.

You can also build documentation yourself. CrashRpt documentation can be 
generated using the Doxygen tool. You can download
the tool from <a href="http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/">here</a>. 

To build the documentation, go to the \c docs folder and type in the command line:

\code
doxygen doxyfile
\endcode

When doxygen finishes, go to the top level directory and open \c index.html.
