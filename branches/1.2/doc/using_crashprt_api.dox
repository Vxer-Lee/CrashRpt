\page using_crashrpt_api Using CrashRpt API

CrashRpt library provides several API functions, structures and classes that can be used in your 
project (see \ref CrashRptAPI, \ref CrashRptStructs, \ref CrashRptWrappers). 

\note Older versions of CrashRpt provided different set of API functions that are now 
declared obsolete. They are still supported for compatibility with older versions of CrashRpt,
but it is recommended that you use the newer functions instead. Here is the complete list of
\ref DeprecatedAPI.

All CrashRpt functions have \c cr prefix, CrashRpt structures have \c CR prefix 
and CrashRpt classes have \c Cr prefix.

All CrashRpt functions using character set dependent arguments have two versions of function name 
(multibyte versions are A-suffixed and wide character versions are W-suffixed). For example, crInstall()
function has two versions of function name: crInstallA() and crInstallW(). Typically in your program you use a
character set independent mapping of function name, for example use crInstall() that 
expands into crInstallW() if you use wide character set or into crInstallA() if you use multibyte 
character set.

\section enabling_crash_reporting Enabling Crash Reporting

To enable crash reporting support in your C++ application you use crInstall()
and crInstallToCurrentThread2() functions. There are two functions because of difference in work of
exception handlers. Some of them work for entire process and others work for caller thread
only.

The function crInstall() installs exception handlers that work on per-process basis. Typically you
call the crInstall() in the beginning of your \b main() or \b WinMain() function. 

You pass configuration settings to crInstall() through the \ref CR_INSTALL_INFO structure. The configuration
settings include application name and version, recipient's e-mail address or URL, path for saving error reports,
Privacy Policy URL and so on.

You can also create a crash callback function LPGETLOGFILE() and pass its pointer to crInstall(). 
The crash callback is called on crash and allows to add custom files to the error report or perform
another action.

On application exit, you should use the crUninstall() function to unset exception handlers. 

The function crInstallToCurrentThread2() installs exception handlers that work on per-thread basis. 
In a multi-threaded program you call the crInstallToCurrentThread2() for all 
threads except the main one. Typically you call this function in the beginning of the thread
procedure.

Just before the return from the thread procedure, call the
crUninstallFromCurrentThread() function to unset exception handlers from the caller thread. No need to call the
crUninstallFromCurrentThread() function in the main execution thread, because crUninstall() will do that for
you automatically.

You can use \ref CrashRptWrappers to simplify installation and uninstallation of exception
handlers in your program. Use CrAutoInstallHelper wrapper class to install exception handlers in your
\b main() function. In a multi-threaded program, use CrThreadAutoInstallHelper wrapper class to 
install exception handlers in each worker thread.

\section adding_a_custom_file Adding a Custom File

Typically an application creates and maintains a log file where operations and errors are
written. Such log file can be helpful for crash analysis and should be added to your application's error
report. You add application-specific files to the error report using crAddFile2() function.

\section adding_a_custom_property Adding a Custom Property

One way to add application-defined info to the error report is adding a file as described above. But
sometimes you may want to extend the crash description XML file by adding a named literal property to the
file. You can do this through the crAddProperty() function. 

For example, you may need to add the info about the amount of free disk space on a specific disk drive 
at the moment of crash, or about the version of the graphics card driver. 

\section adding_a_screenshot Adding a Screenshot

In 90% of cases, minidump file + crash description XML file would be sufficient. 
The rest 10% require additional information, for example a log that your application maintains. 
This technical information should be enough to localize the probable place in your code which 
was the source of the problem.

However, it may be also useful to have a screenshot of user's desktop at the moment of crash. 
This may help to see which button user clicked before the crash, and to see the desktop state. 
For example, for multi-monitor desktops it may be useful to see if the application window is 
positioned on the primary monitor, on the secondary monitor, or at the boundary of two monitors. 
Sometimes it may be enough to see only the region of the desktop occupied by your application 
and not the rest of desktop.

But there is one thing to take in account. By enabling screenshot capture, you should be careful 
about user's privacy. Some parts of the desktop screenshot may contain private or user identifying 
information: folder names, wallpapers, photos, text fragments and so on. That's why you should 
always provide a link to your Privacy Policy page describing what information you collect on 
crash and what purposes you use it for. By clicking the Send Report button, user confirms he/she is familiar 
with the contents of the error report and accepts the terms of the Privacy Policy.

You can make a snapshot of user's virtual screen or a snapshot of your main window using crAddScreenshot() function. 

\section adding_a_reg_key Adding a Registry Key

Many applications store settings inside of Windows registry. Application's settings might be useful for crash 
analysis. Since v.1.2.6, you can ask CrashRpt to dump a registry key contents on crash. Use the \ref crAddRegKey() function.

\section debugging_a_remote_logics_error Debugging a Remote Logics Error

Sometimes it is required to remotely debug some application logics error. Such an error,
for example, infinite loop in a worker thread, may not cause program crash. To collect the information about
error that doesn't cause crash, a software developer might provide an ability to generate 
error report manually on user demand,
for example on a key combination press. The crGenerateErrorReport() function allows to generate an error
report manually.

\section silent_mode Silent (non-GUI) Mode

<b>Since v.1.2.2</b>, CrashRpt can function in silent mode. 
In this mode, no <i>Error Report</i> window is shown on crash and
no interaction with user is performed.
The silent mode is enabled by specifying the \ref CR_INST_NO_GUI
flag for \ref CR_INSTALL_INFO::dwFlags structure member.

 The silent mode is designed for server applications or services
that do not need to interact with user on crash. 
The silent mode should not be used for regular GUI applications. For regular interactive applications,
a user should provide his/her consent to allow sending the error report.

\section automatic_app_restart Automatic Application Restart

<b>Since v.1.2.4</b>, you can tell CrashRpt to restart your application automatically when crash occurs.
This can be done by specifying the \ref CR_INST_APP_RESTART flag for the \ref CR_INSTALL_INFO::dwFlags structure member.

You can pass command line parameters to the executable being restarted using \ref CR_INSTALL_INFO::pszRestartCmdLine, but can't specify another executable
for restart. Only the same executable can be restarted that was used to start the current process.  

The application is restarted only if at least 60 seconds have elapsed since its start up. This is done
to avoid cyclic restarts of an application that crashes right on its start up. Also, the application is
restarted only if the user does provide his/her consent.

If you generate an error report manually, the caller process is not terminated automatically. If you 
do not want to terminate the caller process, and want to avoid
starting the second instance of the application, specify the \ref CR_EXCEPTION_INFO::bManual flag.

\section handling_structured_exceptions Structured Exception Handling (SEH)

Visual C++ provides structured exception handling mechanism. You may use <i>__try{}__except(Expression){}</i>
construction to catch a SEH exception in a block of code in your program, however this requires some
work to write custom exception filter function. To simplify this, use crExceptionFilter() function instead to
generate the error report when SEH exception occurs. 

\section testing_if_intercepted Testing If Exceptions are Intercepted

When you install crash reporting support to your program, it is important to test if CrashRpt
intercepts exceptions properly. Use crEmulateCrash() function to emulate an exceptional situation. 
You may call this function in each thread of your program to ensure all exceptions will be caught.

\section get_err_msg Getting Error Messages

Typically a CrashRpt API function returns zero value if succeeded and non-zero if failed. To get
text error message of the last called function, use crGetLastErrorMsg().
