CrashRpt distribution contains project Tests that implements automated tests 
for CrashRpt functionality.

To run the tests, go to the \b bin directory and click the \b Tests.exe executable
file name. This should launch a console program that will run a set of test cases.

Test cases are organized into several test suites. You can run tests from all test suites at once,
or to run tests from selected test suites.
