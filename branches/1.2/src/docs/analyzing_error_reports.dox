\page analyzing_error_reports Analyzing Error Reports

When a software release is made and CrashRpt support is enabled in your software, sooner or later you
start receiving crash reports. 

Count of received crash reports may depend on robustness of your software to various 
exceptional situations and on popularity of your software. So it's nothing unusual
if you receive hundreeds of error reports a day. If there are many incoming error reports,
you can monitor and analyse them for the first few days after release, and prepare a hot fix 
release. 

The purpose of the error report is to help you determine the reason of the problem and 
try to fix it. The keyword is 'try', because in most cases you can't fix crash reports as 
you usually do with normal bugs. You usually can't reproduce the error on your machine,
so you can't guarantee it is fixed. So the only way to check is to make fixes in parts of code 
that could cause the crash most probably and to release a new version of software. 

The normal scenario is that your software becomes more and more stable with each release and
less and less error reports are received. 

\section zip_structure The Structure of an Error Report

A crash report is a small ZIP file (usually less than 100 KB in size) containing several files, such as 
 - crash minidump (crashdump.dmp)
 - crash description XML (crashrpt.xml) 
 - and optionally application specific files, for example, application log files.

For more information about using crash descriptor XML and crash minidump, 
see \ref using_crash_descriptor and \ref using_minidump.

For information on how to automate error report processing, see \ref automating_crash_report_processing.

<b>How do I check integrity of a received error report?</b>

You may calculate MD5 hash for your error report and compare it with the MD5 hash 
that is attached to the error report. When you receive error reports using HTTP 
connection, the MD5 hash is passed to the server-side script through the 'md5' parameter.
Since CrashRpt v1.1.1., when you receive error reports using email, the MD5 hash is 
attached to the email.
