If you have ever tried to determine the reason of a crash on user's machine, 
you might know how difficult it is, given user's directions only: "I opened 
something, then I clicked something and then it stopped working". Most of 
users won't contact you to tell about the problem and just give up using 
your program after several crashes. Users who decide to report the problem 
might not have technical knowledge, so it is difficult to determine the reason 
of the problem based on their instructions. This makes debugging remote crashes 
almost impossible, except in the simplest situations. This fact encourages to use 
some tool to automatically collect technical information about the crash and send error report 
over the Internet. 

Now assume you receive tons of error reports from users of your software. You 
would have to spend a lot of time to open each report, analyze its contents and
write some summary about the report. There may be many reports related to the same 
problem, so opening such reports doesn't tell anything new. After the 50th report 
you may become bored and give up further analysis. In the best case, you would 
analyze only part of reports selected randomly, which guarantees you miss some 
rarely reported crashes.

That's why it is important to use special tools to report errors automatically
and tools that help you to post-process arriving error reports.

\section wer_and_breakpad Approaches to Error Reporting

First let's review a couple of well-known approaches to the crash handling, reporting & 
post-processing problem: WER and Breakpad. Then we present our approach, CrashRpt - 
an open-source error handling, reporting and post-processing library, which is 
designed specially for Windows applications created in Microsoft Visual C++. 

Every PC user might have seen the window of Dr.Watson, the Windows' default debugger 
introduced in Windows XP. Dr. Watson is able to intercept unhandled SEH (Structured Exception Handling, SEH) exceptions 
in user-mode programs, and in OS modules. It collects technical information about 
the problem (minidump and textual description) and offers user to send the info to 
Microsoft's server. The developer can browse arriving error reports by registering 
on this server (digital certificate is required). The disadvantage of Dr. Watson is 
inability to use third-party server for storing error reports and inability to customize 
debugger's user interface and report's content.

In Windows Vista, the Dr.Watson was renamed into 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Error_Reporting">Windows Error Reporting (WER)</a>. The 
API allowing to customize error reports was introduced and documented in MSDN. You 
can use the API to add (or not add) minidump, log file, memory block to the report, 
modify user interface appearance, queue report submission or send it immediately 
(after user's consent). You can ask WER to start data recovery operation when you app 
crashes, and even to restart your app. When non-critical error happens, you can create 
error report manually. WER can also notify user if the solution of the problem is 
already known.

Advantages of WER:

 - Native to Windows (no need to distribute), has well-developed functionality and well-documented in MSDN
 - Allows to customize contents of the error report
 - Has sophisticated online error report processing services on their Watson server

Disadvantages of WER:

 - It is not an open-source software
 - Requires you to have digital certificate to access your error reports (costs about USD1500)
 - Doesn't allow to use your own server to store error reports

An alternative of WER is <a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-breakpad/">Google Breakpad</a>. 
This open-source tool is used in Mozilla Firefox 
and Google Chrome browsers. Breakpad is an open-source cross-platform C++ library 
designed for handling exceptions in your program and sending reports to your server 
over HTTP or HTTPS connection. It also provides tools for post-processing minidumps 
which present stack traces and other information in human-readable form. Windows 
(x86) and Mac OS (x86 and PowerPC) platforms are supported. Also (at the moment of writing this text) 
an experimental version for Linux exists.

When an exception happens, Breakpad creates minidump file and delegates further actions 
to a user-provided callback function. The function may silently terminate the program or 
add custom files to the report and launch report sender program. Breakpad provides C++ 
classes implementing minidump processing functionality which can be used for writing your 
custom minidump post-processing tools.

Advantages of Breakpad:

 - Breakpad is an open-source software
 - Is is used in Firefox and Chrome, which means it is wide-spread and well-tested
 - It supports multiple platforms: Windows, Mac and Linux
 - Supports multiple C/C++ compilers, e.g. GCC, MS Visual C++
 - It allows to transfer error reports through HTTPS to your own server 

Disadvantages of Breakpad:

 - It is being developed for all possible platforms and compilers (they are unable to 
   develop a tool which will work well everywhere, it is too much efforts needed)
 - Breakpad is not well-suited to Visual C++. For example, it doesn't handle some CRT errors (at the moment of writing this text). 
 - It uses cross-platform format for storing debugging symbols (instead of PDB files). It makes 
   you to convert PDB files into this format.

Summary. As we see, WER and Breakpad are wide-spread error reporting and processing tools. But WER
requires you to purchase a digital certificate, which may be costly. Breakpad is free, but
you have to convert debugging info into cross-platform format. And Breakpad doesn't suit well
to Visual C++, e.g. it doesn't handle some CRT errors. So, if you write a program for Windows platform
only and use Visual C++ only, you might find the CrashRpt library described below more convenient.

\section about_crashrpt About CrashRpt

<b>CrashRpt</b> library is an free open-source (distributed under the New BSD Licence) error handling, 
reporting and post-processing tool for 
applications created in Microsoft Visual C++ and running under Windows. It supports only one OS 
(Windows), only one programming language (C++) and only one compiler (Visual C++). This allows to assume
it knows all aspects of this environment.

Although CrashRpt is not designed for platforms other than Windows, it handles 
Visual C++ exceptions better than Breakpad (because CrashRpt designed specially for Visual C++).

CrashRpt supports Visual C++ .NET 2003, 2005, 2008 and Visual C++ Express. It can be compiled for 32-bit and 64-bit platforms

It handles exceptions in the main or in a worker thread of your user-mode program: 
SEH exceptions, CRT errors and signals.

Generates error report including crash minidump, extensible crash description XML, 
application-defined files and desktop screenshots. CrashRpt uses Microsoft DbgHelp 
library for minidump creation and post-processing, 
which makes it more stable on all variety of processor architectures.

Presents UI allowing user to review the crash report. Supports privacy policy definition. 
Can display its UI using different languages, which makes it even more suitable for 
multi-lingual applications.

Sends the report in background after user has provided his/her consent. CrashRpt can send error reports not only using HTTP, but also using E-mail. This is suitable 
for users not having servers for storing error reports. To send reports over E-mail, 
user's machine should have a mail program installed, for example Mozilla Thunderbird or Microsoft Outlook.

CrashRpt also has a tool for error reports' post processing. The tool may be useful when you 
receive hundreds of reports a day and need to process them all at once.

One disadvantage of CrashRpt is the fact that you have to distribute additional binaries 
(dbghelp.dll, CrashRpt.dll, CrashSender.exe) with your software (about 1.5 Mb).
