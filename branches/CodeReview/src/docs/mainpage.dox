\section about_crashrpt About CrashRpt

If you've ever been tasked with debugging a fatal exception, you probably know 
how difficult it can be given only the user's steps to reproduce. Many factors 
such as the application's version, user's operating system, and dependent modules 
may contribute to the eventual crash. This makes duplicating the user's environment 
and thereby the crash, nearly impossible for all but the most obvious bugs.

CrashRpt library is a light-weight error handling framework. 
The library will intercept a Win32 structured exception and a C++ exception 
generated by a user-mode application. CrashRpt DLL works like  
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._Watson_%28debugger%29">Dr. Watson</a> 
utility that ships with Windows XP, or like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Error_Reporting">
Windows Error Reporting</a> in Windows Vista. 
CrashRpt intercepts an unhandled exception, creates a minidump, builds a crash descriptor in XML format, 
presents an interface to allow user to review 
the crash report, and finally it compresses and sends the crash report to the
software support team.
