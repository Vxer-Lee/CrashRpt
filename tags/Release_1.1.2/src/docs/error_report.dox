\page error_report About an Error Report

When an error occurs, CrashRpt notifies a user and allows  
to review the report contents. First the main dialog shown above is displayed.

The user optionally can provide his/her E-mail address and provide a short problem 
description. The E-mail address may be later used by software support staff to
contact the user and ask for additional information about the problem.

The 'What does this report contan?' link opens the details dialog, where 
files contained in the report are presented. Double clicking on the 
filename will open the file using its associated program, if an association exists 
for the file type.

Once the user is satisfied, he may close the details dialog and click the 'Send report' 
button on the main dialog. If the user doesn't want to send the report, he clicks the 
'Close the program' button.


The error report refers to a collection of files intended to help the developer 
diagnose the cause of a crash. 

The error report contains crash minidump file (crashdump.dmp), which has operating system 
version, processor type, CPU registers state and local variables and stack trace for each 
execution thread. The minidump in most cases can be used on developer's side to determine 
the reason of the crash and try to fix the problem.

In addition, CrashRpt generates an XML crash descriptor file. The file contains various
information that might be useful for crash analysis.

Custom files, for example, application log files, can be included into crash report via the 
crash callback.
