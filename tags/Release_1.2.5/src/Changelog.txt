======= Change History ========

--- Ver. 1.2.5 ---

- Introduced an ability to send error reports queued for delivery (issue 33).
  New flag CR_INST_SEND_QUEUED_REPORTS.

- Fixed: zipped file timestamps are incorrect (issue 40).

- Fixed: Release buffer from DnsQuery (issue 42).

- Fixed: exit(1) in different thread may cause crashes (issue 43).

- Fixed: A bug in CScreenCapture multiple monitors

- Fixed: Issue with g_CrashInfo.m_uPriorities. Introduced CR_NEGATIVE_PRIORITY constant.

- Refactored php example of how to receive error reports by HTTP.

- Extended documentation. 

--- Ver. 1.2.4 ---

- Introduced an ability to restart an application automatically on crash. The application is
  restarted only if at least 60 seconds have elapsed since its start. This is done to avoid cyclic
  restarts of an unstable application which crashes on start up. This is the enhancement requested 
  in issue 11.

- Introduced an ability to preview graphics files (BMP, PNG) in Details dialog. This is useful if a user
  would like to preview the desktop screenshot image attached to the error report.

- An ability to not include minidump file into error report. This implements the enhancement requested in
  issue 33.

- An ability to specify custom email text by using CR_INSTALL_INFO::pszEmailText member.

- An ability to specify custom directory and file name for the language file. This will be useful for applications
  that need to modify UI language on the fly. This is requested in issue 34.

- An ability to disable particular error report sending transport by specifying a negative priority in 
  CR_INSTALL_INFO::uPriorities array.

- An ability to specify SMTP proxy for built-in SMTP client. This may be useful for server-side software that
  would need to configure SMTP transport without querying DNS MX (mail exchange) record.

--- Ver. 1.2.3 ---

- Improved file preview in DetailDlg. Now a file can be previewed in HEX or in text mode.

- Ability to customize the port for SMTP connection.

- Fixed: CrashSender Crash (issue 24)

- Fixed: dbghelp.dll cannot be found (issue 26)

- Fixed: Certain fields cannot be omitted (issue 27).

- Fixed: Release LIB configuration is obsolete (issue 28).
  There may be some people using Release LIB configuration, so the configuration was made up-to-date.


--- Ver. 1.2.2 ---

- WTL files are now included into CrashRpt distribution.

- Completely removed dependency on zip_utils (it is better to use minizip).

- Removed vs.2008 project files. If you need to compile in VS 2008 and higher, use VS project convertor.

- Modifyed communication between CrashRpt.dll and CrashSender.exe. Now XML file is used for this purpose instead of named pipe.

- Refactored code. After crash, all complex actions are done outside of the crashed process (inside of CrashSender.exe).
  This includes taking desktop screenshot, minidump generation, file copying, file compression and sending.

- Introduced silent mode (CrashRpt sends report silently without showing GUI). 
  This is useful for services and server processes.

- Improved documentation (restyling).

- Introduced multi-part HTTP uploads. This will help to send large error reports more effectively.

- Fixed: Doesn't work in Windows 2000 (issue 17)
- Fixed: CrashSender doesn't work on Windows 2000 (issue 21)

- Fixed: mistyping? (issue 18)
- Fixed: inconsistency in xml Crash Log (issue 20)
- Fixed some problems with UTF-8 encoded strings written by tinixml.

- Fixed: crprober.exe does not work well (issue 19)

- New: Introcuded an ability to specify the folder where crash reports are created (issue 22)

- New: Introduced an ability to export error report through "Export..." button on Error Report Details dialog.

--- Ver. 1.2.1 ---

- Refactored crash report generation and sending functionality. Now report files are stored 
  in unzipped state, compression is performed during sending procedure. This will be required for
  huge reports (that will be fully supported in the future).

- Added support of x64 platform (issue 7).

- Added an ability to make screenshots of the screen or the main app window on crash 
  through crAddScreenshot() function (issue 8).

- More information is collected on crash (memory usage, open handles count and GUI resources)

- Ability to add custom text properties to the crash descriptor through crAddProperty() function    (issue 9).

- New function crAddFile2() improving the application-defined files addition.

- Ability to control which dbghelp.dll to use (issue 10).

- Ability to define the type of minidump (from normal size to huge size) (issue 10). 
  Contributed by crcode.s.

- Fixed incorrectly displayed file size in DetailsDlg (issue 14).

- Fixed untranslatable Close button of DetailsDlg (issue 15).

- Fixed: Access to CCrashHandler::m_ThreadExceptionHandlers should be synchronized (issue 16).
