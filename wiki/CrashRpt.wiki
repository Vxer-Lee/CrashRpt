*An example of user interface*

CrashRpt intercepts an unhandled exception, creates a minidump, builds a crash descriptor in XML format, presents an interface to allow user to review the crash report, and finally it compresses and sends the crash report to the software support team. It collects all information you need to debug the problem. CrashRpt can deliver error reports using HTTP request, SMTP connection and through Simple MAPI. In addition, CrashRpt is well documented, so its easy to start using it in your project.
