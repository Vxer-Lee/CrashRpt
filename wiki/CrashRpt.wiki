#summary About CrashRpt

CrashRpt library is a light weight error handling framework. The library will intercept a Win32 structured exception and a C++ exception generated by a user-mode application. CrashRpt DLL works like Dr. Watson utility that ships with Windows XP, or like Windows Error Reporting in Windows Vista. CrashRpt intercepts an unhandled exception, creates a minidump, builds a crash descriptor in XML format, presents an interface to allow user to review the crash report, and finally it compresses and sends the crash report to the software support team.
