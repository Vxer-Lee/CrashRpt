#summary About CrashRpt

*CrashRpt* library is a light-weight error handling framework. The library intercepts  Win32 structured exceptions, C++ typed exceptions and C run-time libraries errors generated by a user-mode application. CrashRpt DLL works like Dr. Watson utility that ships with Windows XP, or like Windows Error Reporting in Windows Vista. 

CrashRpt intercepts an unhandled exception, creates a minidump, builds a crash descriptor in XML format, presents an interface to allow user to review the crash report, and finally it compresses and sends the crash report to the software support team. It collects all information you need to debug the problem. CrashRpt can deliver error reports using HTTP request, SMTP connection and through Simple MAPI. In addition, CrashRpt is well documented, so its easy to start using it in your project.
