CrashRpt v1.2.3 improves file preview (HEX and text) in Error Report Details dialog and fixes some detected issues. Below the complete list of changes is presented. 

  * Improved file preview in DetailDlg. Now a file can be previewed in HEX or in text mode.

  * Ability to customize the port for SMTP connection.

  * Fixed: CrashSender Crash (issue 24)

  * Fixed: dbghelp.dll cannot be found (issue 26)

  * Fixed: Certain fields cannot be omitted (issue 27).

  * Fixed: Release LIB configuration is obsolete (issue 28). There may be some people using Release LIB configuration, so the configuration was made up-to-date.

= crashrpt v1.2.2 =

CrashRpt v1.2.2 improves sending error reports over HTTP connection, improves error report generation by doing all complex actions outside of the crashed process, introduces non-GUI mode and restyles the documentation. Below the complete list of changes is presented. 

  * WTL files are now included into CrashRpt distribution.

  * Completely removed dependency on zip_utils (it is better to use minizip).

  * Removed vs.2008 project files. If you need to compile in VS 2008 and higher, use VS project convertor.

  * Modifyed communication between CrashRpt.dll and CrashSender.exe. Now XML file is used for this purpose instead of named pipe.

  * Refactored code. After crash, all complex actions are done outside of the crashed process (inside of CrashSender.exe). This includes taking desktop screenshot, minidump generation, file copying, file compression and sending.

  * Introduced silent mode (CrashRpt sends report silently without showing GUI). This is useful for services and server processes.

  * Improved documentation (restyling).

  * Introduced multi-part HTTP uploads. This will help to send large error reports more effectively.

  * Fixed: Doesn't work in Windows 2000 (issue 17)
  * Fixed: CrashSender doesn't work on Windows 2000 (issue 21)

  * Fixed: mistyping? (issue 18)
  * Fixed: inconsistency in xml Crash Log (issue 20)
  * Fixed some problems with UTF-8 encoded strings written by tinixml.

  * Added support of x64 platform (issue 7).

  * Added an ability to make screenshots of the screen or the main app window on crash through crAddScreenshot() function (issue 8).

  * More information is collected on crash (memory usage, open handles count and GUI resources)

  * Ability to add custom text properties to the crash descriptor through crAddProperty() function    (issue 9).

  * New function crAddFile2() improving the application-defined files addition.

  * Ability to control which dbghelp.dll to use (issue 10).
